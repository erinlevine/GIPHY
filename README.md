# GIPHY
Let's use the GIPHY API to make something rad!


Objectives:
- Generate buttons using JQ and display 10 gifs using the GIPHY API. 
- Along with gifs, their rating must be displayed, as well. 
- User can add their own button by using the text form. 
- User can then click their button and have 10 gifs displayed. 
- Gifs can start playing once user clicks on the gif. 
- Once user clicks on the gif again, the gif stops playing.
